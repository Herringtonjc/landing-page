                        <h3>Materials</h3>
                        <p>When buying tools especially, consider the material it is made of. There exists a lot of cheaply made tools on websites like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>. While these are not inherently bad, and I myself have purchased many items such as foam brushes and button snaps for my leather goods, stick to reputable dealers for your main tools. These might include edge bevelers, stitching chisels, and hole punches. Definitely try to avoid buying anything other than bags of leather scraps from anyone other than an actual leather company. You will find more information about some of these in the <a href="#supply">leather suppliers</a> section at the bottom of the page.</p>

                        <h3>Shipping</h3>
                        <p>Another consideration is shipping times and shipping quality. This is another allure for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, especially if you have a prime membership. Many of their items will ship within the day or next. Again, this is fine for non-critical tools or items you will be using. Many reputable dealers will take longer on shipping, but their tools or leather will be well worth the wait.</p>

They also have some pretty good deals on leather, and have several locations around the nation. A big name in leathercrafting to be sure.</p>

Their tools tend to be a bit more pricey, but well worth it.</p>

However, their prices for leather by square footage is undeniably great. The next time I am in the market for a side of some good pull-up leather or natural veg-tan, I will absolutely be giving them a try.</p>
